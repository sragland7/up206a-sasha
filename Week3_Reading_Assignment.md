Reading the picee about the OSMnx module it is interesting to think of street networks as a real-world graph and the use of terms like "edges" and "nodes" is echoed in the work of Kevin Lynch to explain how people navigate and make sense of their cities. I can see how the idea of connectivity can have real world applications in helping to identify which areas of a street network are vulnerable to failure. Having this information can help planners make design changes. OSMnx seems particularly useful for informal networks such as walking or biking paths which I think will continue to be important as we continue to adapt in the age of COVID. Creating maps and visualizations for outdoor networks may be just as important as road networks. I am interested to utlize this module in our data exploration since we will be looking at the effects of the built environment on health. Having a detailed view of the city scape will help us visualize the area and identify built features that relate to health outcomes. The "Off the Grid" was also interesting to read and to think about street networks not just in terms of driving but also walking. As someone who has lived in NYC and Los Angeles I have often attempted to walk somewhere in LA only to discover that the route is unnecessarily circuitous, or steep, or unsafe. This paper helped to conceptualize what I alreadly anecdotally knew about navigating different cities by foot. 

Questions: 
1. How has this data been received by city planners, and do you have cases where it has been utilized to make changes to the street environment? 
2. What role do you see sustainable street patterns playing in the quest for more equitable cities?
