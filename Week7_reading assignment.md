While I have of course experienced the trials of trying to find parking and having to loop around blocks or park far away from my destination and walk, I have never thought about the excess of VMT that this creates (probably because I am not in the transportation concentration). I was very impressed and a bit overwhelmed by the GPS observation method that they produced and it was interesting to hear about the bicycle shadowing they used to observe driver behavior. Based on all the examples where cruising behavior may actually be a different type of driving behavior, the bike shadowing seems like a more accurate option, although labor intensive and time consuming. I'd be interested to see this research done in other cities (like Los Angeles) and see what applications could be made to help reduce driving time. 

Questions: 

Are you able to categorize the type of spaces drivers take? For example, pull in spaces, garage parking, or parallel parking? I can imagine some drivers will bypass a parallel parking space for an easier option even if it is further from the destination. 

Traffic was briefly mentioned at the end and I wonder if you're able to take speed into account? I wonder how traffic and having to navigate around slow downs affects "cruising" behavior?.
