_Ben Welsh Keynote Reaction_

As we've seen (especially over the last year) graphics and charts are a powerful and impactful tool for storytelling.
Whether we are looking at COVID rates, election graphics, fire maps, or rates of police killings; we have been inundated with graphics over the past year. 
Visuals serve our current time of social media consumption and scrolling culture well. 
I think many people (myself included) give more weight to a story or opinion if it is accompanied by a  graphic that backs it up.
However, we are also learning that graphics can be easily manipulated to push a certain agenda, just how any opinion and bias can be backed up if one cherry picks information. 
And anyone can be made to seem like an expert on a topic if they can back it up with facts and figures they have chosen to back up their point. 
I particularly enjoyed Ben Welsh's keynote talk because it showed how good graphics are backed by data and just how much work can go into meaningful visuals. 
Ben shared how some of their visual stories have been the most trafficked pages, including their COVID count map (the highest trafficked page in the history of the LA times).
This points to how important visuals will continue to be and makes the case for visuals backed by data.I really enjoyed his talk and am inspired by the direction in which one could take their data and mapping skills.
