As we've seen (especially over the last year) graphics and charts are a powerful and impactful tool for storytelling.
Whether we are looking at COVID rates, election graphics, fire maps, or rates of police killings; we have been inundated with graphics over the past year. 
Visuals serve our current time of social media consumption and scrolling culture well. 
I think many people (myself included) give more weight to a story or opinion if it is accompanied by a  graphic that backs it up.
However, we are also learning that graphics can be easily manipulated to push a certain agenda, just how any opinion and bias can be backed up if one cherry picks information.
