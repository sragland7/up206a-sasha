My name is Sasha Ragland, I am a second year MURP student concentrating in design and development. This course deals with spatial data science which I understand to be the union of **data/ information** and **visual representation**. 

I am interested in a few project ideas: 
* How environmental hazards in Los Angeles have changed over time in terms of physical location and the populations they affect. 
* Where community beautification/ investment projects are located in the city of Los Angeles and what populations they serve.

As a design and development student I have experience making maps in illustrator but I look forward to learning how to map in this course. Through my summer internship I have delved into a ton of census data and I look forward to learning how to make visual representations from the data I find. My professional experience has shown me how powerful visual aids can be in conveying information and how they can tell a story. I think it will serve me very well in my profession to be able to understand data, how to find it, how to analyze it, and how to present it in a digestable way. I hope these goals can be accomplished in this course!
